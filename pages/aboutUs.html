            <p>Clockwork Studios understands the struggles game developers go through in the industry, so we allow them as much time as possible to bring you the best product possible.</p>

            <p>Our CEO Lindsey Lane openned the studio in 2014 after working 20 years in the industry at various companies, including EA Games and Activision. After experiencing the crunch time her employers often put onto her, she decided to open up her own studio so newer developers wouldn't have to go through what she did.</p>
            
            <p>Here at Clockwork Studios we give developers however much time they need to complete games, even allowing them to shift between projects as they please. This has clearly worked, as all of our games have been outstanding successes. We have many more games to come, both new and old, all filled with love from our developers.</p>
